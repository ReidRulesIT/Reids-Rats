Hello my minions, 

hope you're ready to embark on the craziest class of your middle school career. We're all about learning while having fun in this class. I hope you enjoy the course and remember that you're going to get out what you put in. So, come everyday, don't disrupt instruction time and show peers/staff respect and it's going to be a year you will never forget!
